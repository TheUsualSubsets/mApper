### KNOWN BUGS

__1.__ Cookies don't totally work - if you switch the user, it makes user undefined, instead of taking you back to the instruction page to log ing with new initials


__2.__ Sometimes it will freeze after 6 rounds....but usually not


__3.__ We are querying the entire DB every time, which is probably not the most efficient method

__4.__ If the browser is zoomed in (or in some cases if the resolution is very different from what the game was designed for) the list of cities at the bottom of the screen will render really....wrong-looking.
